# 🛠️ Railway Deployment Troubleshooting

## ❌ **Error: Railway using old Dockerfile.railway**

**Problem:** Railway build log shows it's trying to use deleted files:
```
[internal] load build definition from Dockerfile.railway
COPY requirements.railway.txt requirements.txt
ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement ccxt==4.1.92
```

**Root Cause:** Railway cached the old deployment configuration.

## ✅ **Solution Steps:**

### 1. **Verify Current Files**
Run our verification script:
```bash
./railway-clean-deploy.sh
```

### 2. **Force Railway to Use New Configuration**
The issue is Railway's cache. Try these solutions **in order**:

#### **Option A: Trigger Clean Deployment**
1. Commit and push all changes:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix Railway deployment - use main Dockerfile"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. In Railway dashboard:
   - Go to your service
   - Click "Deploy" → "Redeploy"
   - This should use the new `railway.toml` config

#### **Option B: Disconnect and Reconnect Repository**
If Option A doesn't work:
1. Railway dashboard → Service Settings
2. "Disconnect" GitHub repository
3. "Connect" GitHub repository again
4. This forces Railway to re-scan your repository

#### **Option C: Create New Railway Service**
If Options A & B don't work:
1. Delete current Railway service
2. Create new service from GitHub repo
3. Add environment variables again
4. This guarantees a clean deployment

### 3. **Environment Variables to Set**
Make sure these are set in Railway dashboard:
```
SECRET_KEY=your-super-secret-jwt-key-production-2024
SENDGRID_API_KEY=SG.your-sendgrid-api-key-here
FROM_EMAIL=your-verified-email@domain.com
```

## ✅ **Verification**

**Your deployment is fixed when you see:**
- ✅ Railway uses `Dockerfile` (not `Dockerfile.railway`)
- ✅ Railway copies `requirements.txt` (not `requirements.railway.txt`)
- ✅ `ccxt>=4.0.0,<5.0.0` installs successfully
- ✅ Build completes without errors

## 🎯 **Expected Success Output**
```
[internal] load build definition from Dockerfile
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir --timeout=1000 -r requirements.txt
Successfully installed ccxt-4.4.100 (or similar)
```

## 🚀 **Final Result**
Your app will be live at: `https://your-app-name.railway.app`

---

**Key Fix:** Railway now uses the correct files thanks to:
- `railway.toml` with `dockerfilePath = "Dockerfile"`
- `.railwayignore` to prevent old file conflicts
- Single `Dockerfile` and `requirements.txt` (no more duplicates)
